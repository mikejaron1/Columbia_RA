She went and found the assist mgr n told him what I had said, and he told her to watch the front end and have me find him, I did and he told me to hand my keys and walkie, and go on home. I did and about a week later the other assist mgr asked if I was there said night and I explained what had happened to her, and she said that I had been pointed for not being there, but she went in and fixed it."

I mean anyone gay or straight should be careful about hitting on our coworkers to avoid possible accusations of sexual harassment. But asking someone to eat lunch with you or hang out outside of work would not be inappropriate.  But if your CSM says anything to you that makes it seem like you need to hide the fact that you are gay, well then that's discrimination and it's against the law."

I've worked at 7 different Walmart facilities and from my experience the smaller ones sometimes have it harder due to the fact that every time someone calls out the percentage of workforce missing is greater than at a store with more employees. For instance I worked at a small neighborhood market and most days we would only have maybe 4 people so if 2 people call out that's 50% of the workforce. Plus at that store we did so many sales that even though you could only fit 6 pallets in the back room , some days we would get 17 pallets . Also our milk cooler could only hold 5 pallets so with 3-4 pallets of vendor milk it was a challenge when you got 2-4 pallets of dairy."

I have to talked to a bunch of people and the workload seems to be kinda even. There is way less people at a market and so the work load isn't that easy. I work overnights and we get the same size trucks as the super centers with the same number of people they have just in grocery. Not saying they markets do more. Just saying that that from where I'm at it seems equal.

I was the only one working customer service, I got a call, the lady had lost her wallet. I called my CSM because we keep them locked in the C/O. I put her on hold and helped a customer in line and then my CSM came back an told me it was not in our lost and found. I told the customer on the phone we didn't have it, she thanked me. Then proceeded to tell me a ten minute story on how she thinks she lost the wallet in excruciating detail. Meanwhile the line at customer service just got bigger and bigger."

I think the discount given to employees is a bunch of b/s! Should be 10% across the like EVERYONE else in retail or whatever the percentage is for any given company. But we don't get jack on food ! I spent $15 on food for dinner and not one penny came off. The everyday low price crap don't cut it either because Walmart is not that low a price on food. So how many folks believe the discount is fair? I think it should be across the board electronics garden tires and FOOD same percentage!

It's on the Walmart App. You scan your Walmart receipts and if your local competitors have the items you bought at lower prices you get the difference back. You can have it sent to an eGift card which will be sent in an email. And you can scan the barcode at the register. Or you can have your $$ sent to a Bluebird card. David has not yet transferred his. You click on ""Get it back"" when you are ready to use your reward dollars. It takes 24 hrs for it to be loaded to your eGift card."

I also have asthma which makes it harder for me to breath. I cannot stop coughing. Both customers and associates look at me crazy. The doctor gave me a note telling me I cannot return to work but if I miss work I get points. Dont these people realize things happen. I guess you have to be actively dying or bleeding before they give us the time off.

Had a fever of 104 and had to go to the hospital with the start of pneumonia, couldn't stand hardly and was highly contagious. Being a cashier I could have started an epidemic touching everyone's stuff including animal and baby items but they didn't care. Even the hospital was shocked saying I should be home and stay away from people til I got better. There was one woman working there who was dying from cancer and they gave her a hard time about missing work for chemo, her reason for wanting to work was to feel like she was still part of something but I do think considering what she was going through they should have been more reasonable with her."

You call in, you deserve to get points, especially when it's for stupid shit half the time (I live in college town). You come in on your day off, that's your choice. You stay late, your choice again. The points are there to help weed people out. Sick for more than a couple days? Get LOA. In your first 6 months, you have 7 days to be less than 2 hours late (3.5 points) OR 3 days off. At 6 months, you have 17 days to be less than 2 hours late (8.5 points) or 7 days off. LOA is there for a reason"

You'll  have 5hrs to do things in the morning till 11: 30 give yourself 1/2  hr. to relax.  If not 8 till 4. Brkfst would be at 5pm  10: 00 lunch  3am dinner.  Working nights you have to change your eating time. You'd want to have time to digest your food b4 bedtime.

You're taking time away from the receiving associates' job or manager or whomever would have to stand at that door for you.  Just ask for a courtesy associate and maybe another male associate to do a team lift. Just like any other customer.

We often let customers who order large items use alternate doors they can pull up to to load their items. But if that isn't typical in your store, maybe just ask for help with carryout."

And i hate thiefs!! So always wears the same sweatshirt so i know its her... Well i was getting ready to go to break as she walks by. So i let the cashier know who it was and i went and found the nearest CSM. who also knows that shes a thief.. She caught her last time. Well anyway she said to let the other cashier know when she xomes to self check to shut down the 2 farthest registers down (those are the ones she always goes to because she thinks we can't see her. Well AP was there and the CSM let him know about her. So he started watching her... As she came to self check out she made a V line for 44 and 45 (the farthest smallest registers we have) well AP was there watching and the CSM was also there watching the screen as she was scanning. You could tell she was nervous with all of us there üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ so she went to pay for her stuff and she tried putting Vday cards in her bag without scanning and the CSM caught that.. So she goes to leave and AP started to walk toward her and she froze and asked if she could leave her cart there for a second. The CSM said sure so she bent over quick and ditched a bumch of stuff she had on her. Then said she was going o Customer service. Walked around ditched some more stuff... Went to walk out with AP right behind her... She darted back in quick and dro]ed the rest of her crap by our pop display... It seems like she would have cought on because last time she came threw i turned off those 2 registers lol i dought she'll be back anytime soon... AP said next time shes in shes going to jail... No question... So Im pretty proud of myself for alerting and the CSM for helping me watch her and AP for scaring the shit out of her üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

If the reason you say she's rude is because she wouldn't give him any info well its time to be grown and make the call yourself your parents can't always fight your battles for you. He can sit next to you and help you on the right words to say if that would help though

I'm Sure they would talk to you if you call or go up there. Good luck and be careful who you burn bridges with if you want to come back to The company later.

I think there's more to the story ..  hence why she isn't saying what was said

Did that for a year and a half, and then asked them to let me step down and go back to 3rd shift due to some family issues. I love 3rd shift so much more. Way less drama and only 1 manager telling you what to do all night instead of 4-5 different ones."

I went in to sign my job offer for Support Manager.. and my password has changed ..  I am a transfer and it's been two weeks I have not been in the old store .. my schedule is now blank at the old store . My transfer was approved and all .. but has my password changed and to what.. We called tech and they could not give me my own password .. and the old store was contacted to change it but what they changed it too does not work either ..   Why has my password changed and how can I find out what it is ?   Thanks for any answers üòÅ

Except for tasking in. But on the telxon you have to go to another screen for that too. In fact you have to go to a different screen everytime you try doing something on those things.

OK, this is fixable with time, and upper level MC (quite a few levels)  Now, the Old dinosaur used Linux programming, which is the basis of all Global programming structure for Wal-Mart, and most banks world wide, while MC's work off of phone apps, which almost anyone can write, for there are programs to do this for you, and why is this of importance?  Simple all phone apps that I know of are hackable, while Linux in proper code is not, hackable except by some geniuses.   But, since the company wants us to switch, I except the challenge and hope for the best; for this all can be improved and the new apps I am seeing (but not tested properly before release) makes the future look real good!!!"

This is one reason they use Linux to begin with, for if they used a Windows based Server, it would take twice as long, and that is a garuntee."

His answer was answered above (for maintenance they drug test) but there's so much shaming going on. How can someone say you don't deserve a job if you're on drugs? Poverty and addiction go hand in hand. There's the stereotype that drug addicts are unemployed and live off the system - well, how are people supposed to better their life if they're told they don't deserve a job. Don't work high. Try to get help. If it's weed, do your thing because the war on marijuana is baseless. #legalizeit BUT don't you dare shame someone for trying to get a steady income."

Work you shelf availability reports and not scanned. 2 and 46 is pretty easier if you use the tools provided

I have been a cashier for Walmart for 11 years tomorrow and I see the 10 action code a lot and it concerns me because you never know who could walk up to the register and take all the money and walk out. I hope it never happens but you never know. Be safe and scan on.

Not only did we have to hazmat all that mess but it ruined about 40  99 supply boxes that qe need to ship claims. We had to move cabinets and pallets to clean underneath and it went under the gun storage locker!! Which we will never be able to clean!! So ya that's how overnights hurt me today!#

We cant have them back because its cross contamination. We now have almost NO RACKS for our department. They did the same thing to our bakery. They also took all our wipes and hid them for themselves. They make messes in areas they aren't supposed to be in and we have to explain it wasn't like that when management walks us through before the end of the night it got ruined after we left. I worked overnight, most of what they ""get in trouble"" at my store for is VERY justified"

I miss being in the classroom but, my current employer pays me much more than ANY school district.  A little boy was in the toy aisle today and I was walking by and I stopped.  He looked at me and I looked at him, I then proceeded to walk down the aisle and say, ""whatcha doing?"" He knew he was caught! He was trying to steal a toy wrestler.  I soo blew my cover but I just had the need too because the world already sees black males as criminals anyway so I talked to him about stealing and how important it is not to steal. I told him I worked for Walmart and he replied, ""where's your blue?"" I told him don't worry about all that because I could have called the police on him if he was not 8 years old.  I then met his Mom and she had tears falling from her face she was furious.    Moral of the story: keep your kids with you in stores.    AP here.."

He has warrants out of Colorado(?) for kidnapping a young woman and her baby. He had the baby with him when they arrested him. Didn't definitively say it was her in the dumpster. :/ Praying for her family.

If a smoker can't have a cigarette in there then smokeless tobacco and vapes shouldn't be either.  I still used mine outside before they started posting the signs.

As for high blood pressure and increased heart rates, from smoking to vaping my blood pressure and heart rate has come down to almost normal levels. I'm talking like 3-7 points away from normal. The whole claim that the fruity flavors are going to get kids hooked is a load of bologna. Alcohol has sweet/fruity flavors and kids still get ahold of it as easy as cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Diacytle is mainly found in cake flavors and butter flavors. Even then, your looking at 1 part per million. To get any damage to the lungs it wltld have to be a constant exposure to the chemical. That being said the fda has strictly regulated the use of Diacytle. PG is a substance used in many places. It's 2 main uses are in antifreeze and hospital air systems. It's use in antifreeze is to make it less harmful if swallowed. And it'd use in hospitals is to sterilize the air. VG is used everywhere you go in life. It is made from vegetables and can be found on every piece of produce in and given store. It increases the shelf life of fresh fruits and veggies while not being toxic to the human body.  In summary, every claim in this post on what's IN e-cigs is inaccurate except for the part on diabetes. That all being said, not here bit ching at you, just asking you to talk to someone who vapes or a doctor and get the information from a creditable source.  I'm very proud in and of myself. Was addicted to cigarettes for 5-6 years and went over to e cigs. I'm now down to 0 nicotine but I still use it on a daily basis because my doctor and I have found it helps with chronic sickness.

The vapor smoke is in most cases a combo of nicotine and other chemicals that can be toxic. If anything a chemical combo is worse than tobacco!!! So don't give me that bull about the vapor being harmless. I told that to a local vap store owner. Also lithium batteries in the devices have exploded and hurt smokers and any other person nearby.

Do you know how many companies i truat to get vape from? Well it's1 and it's because i know the owner and they use 100% medical grade glycerine(the stuff used in medical vaporizors) they use real organic flavors and that's it. I can absolutely see the issues with vaping around other people because as stated above it can actually be worse than second hand smoke

This is what even my doctor said.  When you smoke cigarettes it is a dry smoke but when you vape it is a wet smoke.  so your lungs have to get used to it.  Now if you don't use either it is probably just the scent of the vape that made you cough.

The only thing your exhaling is water vapor there are no metals inhaled.  Higher success rate of quitting  smoking about 35% of smokers who went to vaping have quit smoking.  The horror stories of batteries exploding has come from ppl who have not educated themselves on battery safety and try to do advance vaping when they should not be doing no vase pens have exploded just advanced ecigs mods. I have been vaping and have had no problems and have better health. Going on 27 months no smoking

Vaping is definitely a healthy alternative to cigarettes, and if someone tells you differently, they are an idiot and you should not listen to them. Cigarettes have 4,000+ chemicals in them, most of which are your carcinogens. Reputable e-liquid, such as Madvapes, Kure, High Life, etc are held to certain standards and they do not place any unnecessary ingredients in their liquids. Common Vape liquids have about 5 ingredients, Propylene Glycol, or PG, Vegetable Glycerin, or VG, Nicotine, which is completely optional, flavoring, and some contain water. So, no, cigarettes are definitely way worse than vaping. Study your facts before you try to defend the tobacco industry, which I can promise you does not have your best interest in their mind."

But in my opinion it shouldn't and should be allowed you get what I'm saying? Cause we want to have a comfortable environment for everyone so like maybe a vape pen would be fine but not a whole mod that makes you look like a chimney personally I smoke cigarettes I never got the same satisfaction from vapor.

If it something discarded then it is TRASH. Trash ends up in a landfill which just takes up space. If you recycle then you are NOT taking up space in a landfill, Even Walmart themselves claim that they are a SUSTAINABLE company. Which basically means recycle at all cost so that crap doesn't end up in landfills. This is why they did away with paper checks so they could save the trees. I would really fight this Bryan Hoff. Remind Walmart that they claim to be sustainable and that you are helping them keep that promise."

It's not a set dollar amount and walmart doesn't sell empty cans. Just like phone cards they are valued at 0.01 if we see someone stealing them we can not apprehend them. They are worth nothing!

For example....they bring you a prepaid phone to ring up and then they say ""and I'll take a 60 minute card."" Ok why the hell didn't you grab it when you grabbed the phone???? Or they bring you to an item to unlock it and say I'll take this one and touch it to indicate that's the one they want and it's not a locked item. I'm like ""ok, go ahead and get it then"" they look at you super confused and I say "" it's not locked. You can just pull it off"""

Nothing written on cc statement to indicate how much she wanted to pay. I ask  her if she wanted to pay $100. She responded  (while on phone) yes (shakes head). I hand her the statement and receipt.  Then she ends her phone call and asks for her change. I explained to her I asked her if she was paying $100. And that she conformed it on the card reader machine. She was mad at me. I thought to my self well get off your damn phone and pay attention.

I would not be asking their permission to go to the bathroom.  I'd shut off my light. Help the current customer I'm ringing out  then go. Whether or not the csm said yes or no.      They have no right to tell me whats excessive and what's not...   they have no clue if it's a medical condition  and technically has no right to ask of it is or not...

The thing is if it is medical then it should be reported period.  If it is constantly taking a 15 min break then going and you have no medical reason it becomes stealing time.  Every once in a while fine but everytime no.  You can actually be coached for stealing time.  Also yes the CSM should be made aware of medical issues because we are management and it does help to know this information.

I don't believe you can be denied a bathroom break.  However, you can be sent on your 15 minute or lunch early if a bathroom break is requested before hand.  And as a cashier, it is a must that a bathroom break is requested, so that the CSM's know where you are and/or can send a replacement to cover if it is necessary."

Now, by this time the morning crew has been coming in and they all have their own radios.  The support manager was to lazy to come see what i needed so over the radio i had to say i needed to go to the bathroom.  I heard me echo all over the store from the other radios.

But customers want it now. They don't want to wait on someone to come cut their fabric. They have employees doing different things because they think it will cut costs but in fact it's making the customer angry cause they have to wait. I don't work in fabrics. I work in wireless. But it makes a big difference when you have the time to take with a customer to make sure they get what they are paying for. Remember, they are the reason we have a job!"

There are 3 associates plus a dept manager at my store.  It's a shame other stores aren't the same way.

I understand it's the direction of the world, but seriously...is there no place at Walmart for human interaction? I'm not talking about sales associates being called to  cashier or zoning or someone called in. I know this a part of retail. If joy in your life is found in fabrics, and Walmart is going to sell piece goods, this should be a customer service area-not a self service area. imo. üòî"

Sorry I have to rant for a moment. But I see it a lot and not just in this company but many companies. You can't treat your team bad you can't put all the blame on your team it just doesn't work that way! I'm not in any manger spot myself but if I was I tell everyone I believe in two key words: 1) teamwork 2) communication. With these two things I believe many of your issues could be solved! We are a team it's not one specific persons fault and no one should just not take responsibility for the actions in your area. We all should be communicating and having a great knowledge about what's going on on the other shifts. If you are communicating with your team will help you know issues going on and help you solve them and make sure you can guide them with the right knowledge to do the job right the next time but instead putting blame on them is not the right answer. Guide them and build them up and you'll get the best out of them.

I pay back 20 bucks from each paycheck until paid in full. Not a bad deal if your in a tight spot. The repayment at 20 per paycheck for that amount isn't breaking the bank either. I'll probably throw in some bigger chunks to payback, not this bonus, but next ones coming, to pay off sooner and save on interest. The good thing is as it's just a loan from it, I believe the 401k keeps growing as you are still paying back (I hope anyway, gotta check that)."

Our store (1926) fired 13 cashiers in a single day for being over the maximum points. But somehow a cashier with 20+ points wasn't fired. Unfortunately the rules don't always apply to everyone.

I got LeBron and Asdrubal autographs and even sold Asdrubal a camera. He was on his way back home after Boston knocked the Indians out of the 2007 playoffs. After I sold him the camera I shook his hand, thanked him for a great season, and asked if I could possibly get an autograph. He was a very cool guy."

So much hate and prejudice in this world.  She's not and has never been an illegal.   She's worked hard all her life and she is good at her job.

While I was a cashier, I was once just doing my thing and ringing people out, when suddenly somebody came up with a shopping basket. Soon she put it on the counter and started unloading it, and suddenly a little kitten jumped out and began tackling my hand as I rang up his toys. I held onto him as the customer paid, then handed him back to his new momma as she left. And that became the day I loved my job again."

But allowing an animal to run or fly around the store for days or weeks can get Wal-Mart in serious trouble in most all states and municipality's.

Us we only coach people if they really don't do their job. So I don't know the circumstance for this one. The only thing would be if you failed to do whatever that success coaching was about. If they coached you and then never followed up to make sure you understood, that's on them. Not on you. The academy told me ""just because you tell someone what to do, doesn't mean they know how to do it."" So if it's that case, I'd bring it up to someone higher on the chain of command. Some stores like to break policy and abuse power. Mine does that shit in a heartbeat. If something is unjust, never be afraid of open door policy."

Can they wait a week? Yes. I've heard of coachings being done a month after whatever happened. But that's usually because an investigation needed to be done.

The only real way to know is to run the application. Just be careful, all store cards have very high interest rates and if you don't pay off within the promotional period, you'll get hit pretty hard. If you have debts in collections probably not a great idea to get another card. You can do as you wish of course, I know its hard to get by when in debt but another card will just add to the problem. There are other solutions. Been there. Just hate to see others make same mistakes I did."

Tell them, they're funny. Here's one of mine:  many yrs ago I'm checking bullpen, only lane open about 2:30 AM.  Young lady about 25 comes thru line, alone, dressed as if she is in night-time entertainment(if you catch my meaning) Ph this is a very small town, laid back n rural. Lady's purchase nothing unusual, a drink, some HBA, maybe some cosmetics, the usual.  Nighttime backroom associate D** come up behind her with his lunch, a triangle sandwich and a monster.  He's a great guy, we are good friends, he's friendly and still works here, he's a gr andpa, but sometimes he's a little slow mentally.  So I total the lady's purchase, 26-27 $ and she gives me all ones, neatly creased.  So as I'm recounting her bills D** looks over, smiles at her and says ""must be a waitress.""  At this point she hesitates and says ""Well......kind of.""  At this point I look up and catch D*** eyes and wink and slightly grin"". Then he starts to really smile , he now gets it, 24 -25and your receipt and 36 cents changethank you.""  She politely gets her change and bag and heads to the door, and as she exits me and D**+are having a good ha -ha and he's looking a bit embarrassed!"

A $3 item where they consumed maybe 1/100 of the product.  So about 3 cents worth of product. A product that the next person won't even be able to tell the difference.  The average Walmart customer spends $2,400 per year.  You want to give up $2,400 per year over 3 cents of body spray?  When I was a Store Manager I came across the same line of thinking from APAs and APMs pretty frequently.  My response was always go catch the guy stealing 3 TVs at a time and leave my customers alone. The people wrapped up in the petty are typically the ones that are not capable of catching the thieves that really hurt the business."

However also the pathways tell us what to do if you feel you are being singled out etc. You can go to another department manager and tell them. Go up the path of chain of command.

Tell your co worker to go the store manager since it is a co manager she thinks is the issue.  Open door is with the next level of salaried management. Do not tell her to go to a dept. manager unless she wants everyone to know her business.

I don't like working their stuff cause they always complain. Like saying I don't rotate their stock and what not. It's like come one man I do rotate your stuff. One time I had three days off in a row and found completely green bacon on the shelf as a customer told them about it and came in the next day to work and saw the same package of bacon still on the shelf.

Same reason overstock.com isnt the behemoth it was once projected to be.

Deal with broken sauce jars and torn open bags of flower. Just keep overlooking the fact that those items are protected by the cushion of pet food and bird seed.

If they scare you that much then they're not a very good manager. You can always call your market team and ask to be hired at a different store or ask for an open door to justify you getting rehired. Associates should never feel threatened by their mgrs.

He told me sometime last week the system marked him as late but he wasn't late. He came to clock in yesterday morning and it said he was terminated. Not one single member if management bother to tell him. I understand it's his responsibility to keep track of those but I still think the situation is stupid and he should come back. A couple months ago now we lost another electronics associate. He wasn't here for 6 months yet but you know how you're able to clock out earlier than your expected end shift time? Well I guess he clocked out a minute, ONE MINUTE early and they fired him over that. Like maybe he didn't realize what time it was? And is management going to replace these two associates? Nope."

I have broughg my kids in pjs. Sometimes u have sick kids needing med. And nobody to watch them. If ur like me its harf to change more then one kid plus ur self and then rechange them again. Sometimes circumstances happen last min at random times. I understand during day or just doing it to do it. But you never know what that person goes threw. I work 12+ hour shifts and get home and get ready for bed along with my kids and got to be up before crack of dawn to take them to sitter and start day again sometimes its a spare of the moment thing. Some may not have anything else to wear. Or be in my shoes just had a c section and cant wear pants yet due to it hurting or rubbing and pjs are the most confortable thing to put on.

We have an opening on our 3rd shift for support manager and this woman is trying to go for the position but her ex husband (and father of her children) works on our shift. Can she still be eligible for the position?  To me it sounds like a conflict of interest.  Is it considered to be conflict of interest? ???

He always said any issues were because of 1 of 2 things. Skill or will. Either you don't have the skill to do something or you don't have the will to. You would see these issues disappear if everyone was held accountable for their actions. I know if my manager told me I did something wrong and showed me how to do it the right way and then said the next time it happened I would get coached you bet your butt I would make sure I did it right!

What's there is all cat food in the one picture and the other picture is for the dog food. Cardboard is up there because it's a case. You can have 3 cases on top stock. I hate seeing full case boxes up on top stock. I think it would look better if everything was taken out of the cases though. It would make it look like it is supposed to be there.

A very main reason there are so many issues in this district are apparently because of the district manager who has pets and favorites that he puts in stores with zero people skills.

It's happens all the time in both departments. We have a jewelry associate that comes in 8-9 minutes late everyday, stands around and talks to her friends that come in to see her and passes off all the work on everyone else. It's so freaking annoying but management won't do anything. Occasionally an ASM will say something to her, but nothing helps. People like that should honestly be fired."

Section 4 or whatever your last one is in that category first.

More associates scheduled when there's more customers and less associates are scheduled when less associates.  It seems though when there's more customers there not enough associates to assist the customers.

From what I see it isn't customer first it definitely isn't associates first it is corporate pockets first.  The way they are staffing the stores it is just another way to cut down on hours.
